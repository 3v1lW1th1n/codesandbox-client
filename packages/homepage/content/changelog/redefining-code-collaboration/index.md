  A big update to CodeSandbox Live — Live by default, new access controls,
  presence, and follower mode.

Collaborating on code can be hard. Historically, web development has been seen
as a solo pursuit with tooling being built for individual developers writing
code locally. In reality, we rarely code by ourselves. While we may often
physically edit code alone, we create things collectively—working within teams
and contributing to group projects. Now more than ever, we need to be able to
collaborate on code. Current events have forced many to embrace remote work, but
developers have been leading that charge for years. Flexible working
arrangements and distributed or hybrid teams are now commonplace, forcing a
fundamental change in how we all create together.

[CodeSandbox Live](/post/introducing-codesandbox-live-real-time-code-collaboration-in-the-browser)
made collaboration easier by giving you the ability to code in real-time with
others. It's used for pair programming, at hackathons, during job interviews,
and in classrooms, enabling two or more folks to work on code simultaneously.
What's more, our [basic team support](/dashboard/teams/new) has reduced friction
in sharing ownership of sandboxes within a group.
