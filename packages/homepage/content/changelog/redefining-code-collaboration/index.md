title: Redefining Code Collaboration
date: 2017-11-16
description:
  A big update to CodeSandbox Live â€” Live by default, new access controls,
  presence, and follower mode.

[CodeSandbox Live](/post/introducing-codesandbox-live-real-time-code-collaboration-in-the-browser)
made collaboration easier by giving you the ability to code in real-time with
others. It's used for pair programming, at hackathons, during job interviews,
and in classrooms, enabling two or more folks to work on code simultaneously.
What's more, our [basic team support](/dashboard/teams/new) has reduced friction
in sharing ownership of sandboxes within a group.
